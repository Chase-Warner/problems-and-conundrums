Problem 2
//Chase Warner sketched 8/29/2017 this sketch is to demonstrate beautiful code// 
void setup() {
 //this line makes sure the rectangle only is created once//
size(1920,1080); 
rect(200,300,200,400); 
//these two lines create a rectangle on a canvas//

}

Problem 3
Colormode(HSB,300,100,100);
//I have absolutely no idea why this doesn't work//  
size(1920,1080);
